# COVID-19 Data Exploration using SQL Server

This project uses SQL Server to explore COVID-19 data and gain insights into the global impact of the pandemic. The project includes various queries that show total cases over total deaths, infection rate in a given country, countries with the highest death count per population, continents with the highest death count per population, and the percentage of population that is vaccinated. The project uses various SQL Server features such as Group By, Order By, Partitions, Joins, CTEs, and Temp Tables to write the queries and analyze the data.

## Data Source

The data used for this project is sourced from a publicly available dataset on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The dataset includes information on various countries and territories around the world, and is updated daily. For more information on the dataset, please refer to the Our World in Data page where the dataset was obtained [Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

## Project Features

The SQL Server project includes the following features:

- Queries that show total cases over total deaths, infection rate in a given country, countries with the highest death count per population, continents with the highest death count per population, and the percentage of population that is vaccinated.
- Use of SQL Server features such as Group By, Order By, Partitions, Joins, CTEs, and Temp Tables to analyze the data and gain insights.
- Visualizations of the data using Tableau [COVID Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/randy.bartolon.barrios6073/viz/COVIDDashboard_16811660536850/Dashboard1)

## How to Use the Project

To use the SQL Server project, download the project files and open them in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The project includes SQL files that contain the queries used to analyze the data.

You can run the queries to explore the data and gain insights into the impact of COVID-19 around the world. You can also modify the queries to focus on specific countries or regions of interest.
